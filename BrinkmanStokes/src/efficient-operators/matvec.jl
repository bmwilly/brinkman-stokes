	benchmark_stokes_matvec()

Benchmark matrix-vector multiplication performance for Stokes flow system.

Sets up a Stokes flow problem on a unit square domain, applies boundary conditions,
and benchmarks matrix-vector multiplication performance. This is useful for
comparing different matrix storage formats and operation implementations.

# Returns
- `Dict`: Dictionary containing timing results and system information

# Notes
- Uses sparse matrix format for efficient storage
- Benchmarks both assembly time and matrix-vector operations
- Compares dense vs sparse matrix operations
